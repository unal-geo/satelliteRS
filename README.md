## Satellite Remote Sensing

The increasing human impact on the environment has led to the development of new observation and analysis tools to monitor types, magnitudes, and rates of environmental changes. Earth Observation (EO) satellite systems and improved mapping and analysis tools are enabling a better understanding of the social, ecological and environmental interactions that transform Earth systems, which is critical for developing sustainable solutions.
